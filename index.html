                    Being super fed up with paying $2.99 for Icloud storage has inspired me to create an automated photo
                    transfer that removes photos from my iphone, and pushes them onto a usb drive. After coding it I
                    realized I
                    need much more storage, and a more efficient way to transfer data. I plan to revisit this soon and
                    make
                    a
                    personalized cloud like storage solution using a rasberry pi and a larger storage device.

                    In my SD2 class we interviewed clients about an app that they wanted to see, taking note of features
                    they
                    requested. My groups project was a super specific dating app. Due to time constraints for the class
                    we
                    were
                    unable to make it as perfect as we imagined, but I was able to experience the whole tech stack and
                    learn
                    valuable skills like agile planning and teamwork. This project uses HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript,
                    flask,
                    and PostgreSQL.
